## About the developer
Hi, I'm Enrico Capano an Indie iOS developer from Italy, based in London.

I have been working as a geotechnical engineer first in Paris and then in London for about 3 years now. I have always been fascinated by people making apps and over the pandemic I decided that my current employment was not going to be permanent. In fact since then, I started to study iOS development on my own. After about 1 year of study I released my first app Neaty and I am now starting to apply for iOS roles.

Besides coding I love to play basketball, watch movies and dance salsa.
